# Youth Club Community Service Tracker 🕒📚

Welcome to the **Youth Club Community Service Tracker** — a sleek, web-based app designed to modernize how student clubs track their community service hours. No more messy pen-and-paper logs or lost signatures! This app makes logging, viewing, and managing service hours easy, efficient, and secure. 💻✨

While it’s built specifically for our club’s needs, it’s open source and fully customizable — so clubs anywhere can fork, rebrand, and adapt it for their own students worldwide. 🌍

## 🚀 Why This App Exists

Many student clubs still track service hours with archaic paper forms that are easy to lose, hard to manage, and a pain to total up. This app solves that problem by offering an easy-to-use online system where students can:

- Register and log in securely 🔐
- Add detailed service tasks with descriptions, dates, and proof images 🖼️
- View their accumulated hours at a glance 📊
- Admins can manage users and tasks via protected pages 👮‍♂️

## ✨ Features

- **User authentication:** Register, login, logout — with secure password hashing 🔑  
- **Role-based access:** First 9 registered users are granted admin privileges automatically (manage users, nuke database, view all tasks). Everyone else is a normal user.  
- **Service logging:** Students log tasks with description, hours, date, and upload photo proof 📸  
- **Task management:** Users can add and delete their own tasks; admins can view and manage all tasks and users  
- **Email contact form:** Students and visitors can send messages to club officers via a contact form with multi-recipient emails ✉️  
- **Bootstrap 5 styling:** Clean, responsive UI built with Flask-Bootstrap 🎨
